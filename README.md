**Maths preparation**
This repository is created to provide a structured and practical summary of core mathematics concepts essential for data science and machine learning. 
It serves as a personal study guide and reference for learners, students, and professionals preparing for data science interviews, academic exams, or practical projects.

**Probability and Statistics**

1:- Descriptive statistics, distributions, Bayes' Theorem
2:- Inferential statistics, hypothesis testing

**Discrete Mathematics**

1:- Set theory, logic, functions, relations
2:- Useful for algorithm analysis and data modeling

Optimization
1:- Cost functions, convex optimization
2:- Gradient descent and related algorithms

**Concept Review: Go through concise notes to refresh your understanding**

Math-to-Code Mapping: Learn how math concepts translate into code (e.g., using NumPy or PyTorch).

Project Preparation: Revisit math topics before starting ML or data projects.

Interview Readiness: Use it as a reference for technical interviews where math foundations are tested.

Self-Study: Use it as a guided roadmap if you're learning math for data science from scratch.
